# ðŸ§  Introvert vs Extrovert Personality Prediction (Kaggle Playground Series 2025)

This project was created for the **2025 Kaggle Playground Series**, which features approachable machine learning competitions using synthetic datasets designed to help data scientists practice modeling, feature engineering, and evaluation techniques.

## ðŸŽ¯ Competition Overview

Welcome to the 2025 Kaggle Playground Series! The goal is to predict whether a person is an **Introvert** or **Extrovert**, given their **social behavior** and **personality traits**.

- **Start Date:** June 30, 2025  
- **Final Submission Deadline:** July 31, 2025 (11:59 PM UTC)  
- **Evaluation Metric:** Accuracy  
- **Submission Format:** A CSV with `id` and `Personality` columns:
This challenge uses **synthetically-generated data** based on real-world behavior traits, making it ideal for testing different ML models and techniques quickly.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset Information

The dataset is derived from a deep learning model trained on the original "Extrovert vs. Introvert Behavior" dataset. You may optionally use the original dataset to explore improvements.

**Files included:**

- `train.csv` â€” Training set with features and the `Personality` target
- `test.csv` â€” Test set without labels
- `sample_submission.csv` â€” Example of the required submission format

**Note:** The dataset is relatively small â€” perfect for fast iteration and visual exploration.
